# Open Customer Data Api

### About it

This is a open source api to simulate a data sharing using a consent base concept. Basicly to share any client data you need
to request him to consent the sharing. On this API we only have account information to be shared
and it will require the right permission and status to allow the success of the api call.
The security of the api is done using a bearer token as a plaintext base64. All the structures are detailed bellow

The security of the Api consist of a jwt token with a header and payload (the sign part is omitted on purpose).
